# Model View Controller Web Application Demo using Laravel

Made for the Topics in Software Engineering class, at EAFIT University. Following the instructions (and book) made by the professor Daniel Correa.

## Implementation

This is a standard Laravel example project, which can easily be created using [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

You can effortlessly create this project using the command `composer create-project laravel/laravel example "12.*" --prefer.dist` (though you can switch 'example' for any name you want the project to have).

While you don't need any other tools to make this simple demo function, it is made simpler to execute and test using a web server of some kind, like XAMPP. Moving this project into the XAMPP folder (or creating it there) might require admin permission, depending on your OS.

On **Windows**, it should be enough to run CMD or MSYS as administrator.

On **Linux** you can just run this using `sudo`, or use `sudo mv path/to/project /opt/lampp/htdocs`

Then, it's as simple as running XAMPP on your OS, and going to localhost on your web browser of preference.
